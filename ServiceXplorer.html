                    </span> Have you ever thought about the number and types of components that business services in your organization depend on to function? Don't forget to add to all this heterogeneity the volume of instances, containers, microservices, applications, and dozens of other components in the cloud or on-premises. <br>
                    <br>With the implementation of a DevOps model, development and operations teams began to use practices to automate processes that historically have always been manual and slow. Now, with integration and continuous delivery mechanisms, the process of launching solutions, from the creation phase to the implementation phase, has made the management of dynamic and complex systems more effective and with less risk. <br>At the same time, new real-time management trends, capable of glancing these different components in a more integrated way at different stages of development, and how much business segments are impacted, have become targets of new monitoring approaches.<br>

          <span style="font-style: normal;"> In fact, what we need can no longer be provided by just traditional monitoring of infrastructure, database, applications or inciden​ts generated by resource planning sws. A change in approach, favoring the construction of operational business centers, looking at the&nbsp;components of a service in an integrated way, establishing rules for status propagation and other dependency relationships, will enable a unified and more practical view of the service maps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">We will start by exposing the main components that govern <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span>, covering some concepts that are the basis for its formation.

            </span>
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">According to Rachel Lebeaux, senior managing editor for SearchCompliance.com, Business Services are referred to as the activities that assist business yet does not deliver a tangible commodity. A Business Service includes one or more technical services that provide value to internal or external customers, and usually includes an associated Service Level Agreement (SLA) that specifies the terms of the service. For instance, Information Technology is one such business service that supports various other business services such as shipping, procurement and finance. <br>
              <br>In a<img align="center" style="width: 187px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil" src="images/treestructure.png" width="570"> nutshell, we can say about <span style="font-weight: 700;">Business Services</span> as being composed by some business processes, monitored through specific business metrics and supporting services an organization offers its customers. The goal of business process monitoring is to extract business events that refer to a well-defined step in the business process activity from transaction logs, which in turn are based on the trace information provided by transactional metrics captured from <span style="font-weight: 700;">Application Layer. Application Layer</span>, composed by applications built over microservices or monolithic architecture.It is critical that we are able to map component items and how they relate to each other to perform the transactions required by business processes. In the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Application Layer</span>, we must define these components and their dependency relationships in a hierarchical model. Even considering that architectures based on microservices naturally have <span style="font-style: italic;">mesh</span> interconnections, it is essential to translate the dependency relationships into a hierarchical model, since that is the model supported by this <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer&nbsp;</span>version. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Walking through the hierarchical model, we reach the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Infrastructure Layer.&nbsp;</span> The <span style="font-weight: 700;">Infrastructure Layer</span> or <span style="font-weight: 700;">Device Service Layer</span> refers all physical or virtual devices, instances, containers, databases, processes and component items, for which are sent status information about traffic, bandwidth, and other sources of resource contentions. One of the great challenges for the construction of the hierarchical tree of services is to map the dependencies of the components present in the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Application Layer</span> with the infrastructure resources of the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Infrastructure Layer</span>, that is, how the transactions are correlated and &nbsp;impacted by the resource pool. present in the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Infrastructure Layer</span>. As can be seen, our concern should be focused on assessments that can establish dependency relationships between the component items, both in an intra-tier perspective and in an inter-tier view.

Thus, an online sales service composed of other services such as customer registration services, inventory control, electronic invoicing, distribution and logistics, , must all be grouped within the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Business Service layer.</span>&nbsp; In the other layers, the same modeling criterion should be adopted in all other layers

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Before proceeding further, defining how <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">ServiceXplorer</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;</span>should operate in the service tree, let's talk about some concepts and rules that must be observed when building the hierarchical structure.

          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Since the dependency relationship between the componentes &nbsp;is based on a hierarchical structure, it is necessary highlight definitions, levels and functions of each node or component, over this mapping. As can be seen in the figure below, , any subnode of a given node is called a <span style="font-style: italic;">child node</span>, and the given node, in turn, is the child’s <span style="font-style: italic;">parent</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sibling</span> nodes are nodes on the same hierarchical level under a common parent. Nodes &nbsp;in a highest level than nodes in the same lineage are <span style="font-style: italic;">ancestors</span> and those below it are <span style="font-style: italic;">descendants</span>.

          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 0.4;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Leaf Nodes</span>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">End nodes or leaf nodes (which I will call nodes), are associated with components managed by some monitoring tool capable of generating notifications and alerts. Nodes are primary web services that provide an ability to receive incidents sent by these external management tools, and translate them into the service tree in terms of the degree of severity and impact that this component can have on the servicesof interest.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <br>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">

          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">It is noteworthy that the severity level of an incident, caused by a failure or problem in a component, will not necessarily have similar impact in the service context. As an example, a failure considered critical in some component related to the infrastructure of a server does not mean that the same degree of criticality has to be attributed to the service. Although this server is a key component for the service availability, it is possible that the service has server redundancy and, therefore, that server downtime does not compromise the service unavailability.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <img src="images/subnodes1.png" style="width: 154px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil" width="570">

            <br>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">In the case of subnodes, they are not directly associated with the incidents generated by the monitoring tools. The use of subnodes in the service tree is related to some kind of functional grouping of nodes. Basically, subnodes are created taking into account the grouping category of their children.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The first type of grouping is based on the composition of child nodes. This is commonly seen in situations where the existence of a component (subnode) is only possible with the presence of other components (nodes). Servers and VMs are examples of components created by the composition of other nodes represented by infrastructure components, like cpu, memory, network links p.e.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="isPasted" style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The second category of node grouping is based on indirect dependency relationships. In this case, although the subnode is not composed of child nodes, as infrastructure components, it still depends on child nodes for its full operation.&nbsp;</span>
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">A classic and very simple example to understand would be the relationship between processes and operating system. Although a process (subnode) is not composed of the operating system (child node), problems on OS internal modules, can compromise the availability of processes running on this server. &nbsp;</span>
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Although it is not recommended, you can create a hybrid subnode containing some nodes, which it is composed of, and other nodes, which it only depends on for its full operation.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">As seen at the example in the next figure, the hierarchical tree branch, has 2 subnodes, database and pro<img align="center" style="width: 249px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fir" src="images/subnodes2.png" width="570">cesses, the latter being also a child node of the database subnode. In case of a malfunction of any of the child nodes there will be a possible reflection on the status of these subnodes, but it may happen that the scope of the problem in the child node does not interfere with the parent component (subnode) functioning. Since an Operating System (OS) has different layers, a functional or performance incident in any of these layers will not necessarily impact the status of processes related to the database, although there is a significant probability.

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Status propagation rules define how a component should transmit its severity to its parent node. Therefore, by using status propagation, it’ll be possible define or alter the effect of a component over the parent node status. Currently, the rule to be used can be one of the following:<img align="center" style="width: 330px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil" src="images/statuspropagation.png" width="350">

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Weighting enables you to associate a factor with a component, and consequently affects its status calculation in relation to other sibling components. However, the weight is not taken as an absolute number but as a fraction of all components &nbsp;on the same hierarchical level and having a common parent.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Let's show the calculation performed by <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> when applying the arithmetic mean rule to get the severity status of a parent node. First of all, we must consider the values of normal, warning and critical status as 1, 2 and 4 respectively, and their calculation ranges as indicated in the figure on the side.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Now, consider the following example, where are shown 2 scenarios.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">
              <img src="images/weight.png" align="center" style="width: 440px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic" width="570">
            </span>
          </p>
          <p id="isPasted" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">In the first scenarion , all child nodes have status propagations set as "current" and weights set to the default value (1) and their parent node has its status rule set as arithmetic mean. Taking in account these values, we conclude that the final parent node status &nbsp;should point to a warning severity level. Why ? Since the weight is equal for all nodes, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> simply adds up all the status values of the child nodes and divides by the total number of child nodes. &nbsp;
            </span>
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">But note that this sum of status values must be grouped by weight.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="isPasted">Σ <span style="font-size: 0.875rem; font-weight: 700;">weight x ((number of normal child nodes) x 1 + (number of warning child nodes) x 2 + (number of critical child nodes) x 4)) / total number of weights</span>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.2; text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">After applying the above formula, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> will place the obtained value in the severity calculation range to finally obtain the final status. In our example, the value obtained was <span style="font-weight: 700;">2.33</span> and consequently, the status set to warning.
            </span>
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">
              <br>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p id="isPasted" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Now, consider the second scenario, where the weight of one of the child nodes (child 3) has changed, migrating from 1 to 2. The new weight of child node 3 is causing its share to increase from 33% to 50% of the final calculation, and a decrease from 33% to 25% for the remaining child nodes. We would achieve the same effect if the weight of all nodes were kept at their default value, and one more child node was added, presenting a critical status, like child node 3. Returning to the application of the formula for calculating the parent node status, for this new scenario, we would have:</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">(1 (1 + 2) + 2(4))/4 = <span style="font-weight: 700;">2.75</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">thus, leading to a critical severity range, and consequently establishing a new parent node status to <span style="font-weight: 700;">critical</span>.

              <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;</span>page, builds the components of the new tree using a template tree as reference.

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The other way to create a service tree is through the use of POST operations by using <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">ServiceXplorer'</span>s <span style="font-style: italic;">REST APIs</span>, where all components, their dependencies and attributes are sent through structures in json.

If there is more than one component in the service tree with the same name, the monitoring tool must indicate the correct component via the path name key, sent in the incident body (see the <span style="font-style: italic;">Incident Handling section in Architecture</span>).<br>
          <br>- The <span style="font-weight: 700;">customer_name</span> key is mandatory, and can be related to a customer, an area or a sector of a company.<br>

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">After defining the rules and fundamentals that govern each component, it's time to foster &nbsp;the creation and the service tree assembly. Each component is a cell that stores information about its own configuration and its current status. As will be seen later, the attributes or configuration data are entered during the creation or modification of the component, either using an interactive interface through the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> console, or using the REST API of the <span style="font-style: italic;">API Gateway ServiceXplorer</span>.

          <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">In the following figure, taking the selected branches of a hypothetical service tree, it is possible to visualize within the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Device Service Layer</span>, a single esx server, hosting vms associated with the web and database services, and generating, as a result, components of a same name, although in different contexts. In the first example, after receiving a critical incident from a external toll, related to the esx server infrastructure (“Infrastructure esx server A”), <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> performs the mapping and applies the new status to the “metrics &amp; errors" component. Since there are two components with the same identity, the incident is applied to both components.

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">In this next scenario, although the incident generated by the monitoring tool is associated with the component "network ports", and there are two components having a common identity, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> is able to define the context over which the status propagation should be applied.

Here's a note. For the execution of a notification command, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer&nbsp;</span>creates a thread, without waiting for its execution to finish. The thread, in turn, triggers the command and waits for its completion, because in addition to obtaining the status of the command's execution, the thread needs to read the output generated by the command, especially if this output is the identification of an open ticket, in case the notification command is an integrator itsm. The ticket ID is stored by <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> and allows the integrator program to reference this ID in future calls (such as during a ticket closing operation). This ticket ID can be accessed by the notification command through the <span style="font-weight: 700;">$ticket</span> variable.

Views have been created to address specific web requests: incidents coming from monitoring tools, users asking for changes in the service tree, by using command line or browser interfaces, and periodic heartbeats coming from client browsers for checking status and relationship changes.The proposed architecture aims to address the following concerns:<br id="isPasted">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Services are decoupled, fungible, and independent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Messages are buffered and consumed when resources are available<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Services scale easily for high-volume event processing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Component are highly available and fault-tolerant<br>In this way, the solution offers a viable alternative for real-time updating of the status of components and independence of the rate of incidents, providing adaptability mechanisms (horizontal and vertical) that can be used dynamically, according to the volume of information. &nbsp;

            <br>
          </span>
          <br>Let's start by talking about the flow of tasks triggered during the reception of an incident sent by an external monitoring tool. The figure below is a summary of the different interactions between the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer </span>components present in the flow.
        </p>
        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/FotoJet.png" alt="" data-image-width="1751" data-image-height="853">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Incidents sent by external tools to <i>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">ServiceXplorer</span>,</i>&nbsp;using the RESTful API in HTTP POST requests, are handled by a specific view in the Django context, whose main objective is to validate the request, ensuring that all keys and their respective values, formats and data types sent in the package body, are valid, as well as all fields considered mandatory are present. Also during this step, the <i>validator</i>&nbsp;accesses the service tree database to make sure that the component, referenced in the incident, is a valid component, that is, it is part of the service tree and has an active monitoring status.&nbsp; In the figure above, a snippet of the json structure sent by the external monitoring tool to <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer </span>is shown. Here are some comments worth mentioning.&nbsp;The customer key can be related to a customer, an area or a sector of a company. The name key in the "component" key corresponds to the parent node of the component represented by the name key inside "subcomponents". If the parent node identity is absent, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer </span>will associate the incident with all components with the same identification of the name key in "subcomponents". It is also worth noting that more than one incident, relating to more than one service tree, can be sent within a single packet.<br>
          <br>After this initial check, the validation function returns an HTTP response, with a status code defining success or failure of the validation process, however, without waiting for the incident to be processed at all stages of the processing flow.&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the Django and Kafka follow a asynchronous model in most of processing and&nbsp; communication between the components present in the <span style="font-weight: 700;"><i style="">ServiceXplorer</i>&nbsp;
          </span>architecture.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>If the incident validation process is successful, the <i>validator</i>&nbsp;calls a async view responsible for publishing the incident using the message broker (Kafka). The topic "Incident" is created with a message describing the incident, the involved component and the event status. The<i>&nbsp;getIncident microservice</i>, the subscriber of the "Incident" topic, consumes the message containing the incident details. and performs the following actions in sequence:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Establishes the component identity and the incident status<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Queries the current status for this component in the service tree database, as well as the location of that component and its parent identification in the hierarchical structure. Since a component can be present at different places in the service tree, more than one record can be returned from this query.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - If the incident status is different from the component's current severity, the component's status is updated in the service tree database, otherwise the processing of the following steps is aborted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - For each hierarchical level related to the location of the component, obtained by consulting the service tree database, the <i>getIncident microservice</i>&nbsp;publishes a corresponding message, containing the parent component identification, and a transaction tag. In this publication, the topic used is identified as "level-&lt;value-1&gt;", where &lt;value&gt; is the number corresponding to the hierarchical level of the component in the service tree.&nbsp;For each hierarchical level related to the location of the component, obtained by consulting the service tree database, the <i>getIncident microservice</i>&nbsp;publishes a corresponding message, with the parent component identification, and the transactional tag. ​Supposing,&nbsp; that a component is present in two hierarchical levels of the tree, level 7 and level 3 for example, two topics will be created, one identified as "level-6" and the other one as "level-2" , respectively. The message content addressed to these two different message queues will have the identification of the corresponding parent in each hierarchical level.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>For each topic "level-&lt;value-1&gt;", at least one subscriber, represented by the <span style="font-style: italic;">"level-&lt;value-1&gt;"</span> microservice, will be responsible for the consumption and processing of the message. Basically, a Level microservice includes the following tasks:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Information from the service tree database regarding the status and identification of the parent component of the component referenced in the message, as well as all its child nodes, including the status, weight and propagation rules are consulted.<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - The new value of the component status is calculated, and if different from the component's current severity, the component status is updated in the service tree database, otherwise the processing of the following steps is aborted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - The&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"level-&lt;value-1&gt;"</span> microservice publishes a message, containing the parent component identification, and the original transactional tag. In this publication, the topic used is identified as "level-&lt;value-2&gt;".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This queuing process follows the same flow until the lowest level of hierarchy is reached, that is, the root node of the services tree, where the figure of a parent component does not exist. &nbsp;Note that the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"level-&lt;value-i&gt;"</span> microservice is both subscriber of the topic "level-&lt;value-i&gt;" and publisher of the topic "level-&lt;value- (i + 1)&gt;", with exception to the getService (or "level-1") microservice, which does not have the publish function.

All modules and microservices, without exception, communicating with MongoDB (NoSQL) and PostgreSQL through the SQLAlchemy ORM library.

              <img align="center" style="width: 334px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil" src="images/queuesdb.png" width="570">Besides the communication between the Level microservices, Incident microservice and Service microservice, based on Message Broker Kafka, another special microservice is part of the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> architecture, whose function is to store the history of all interactions that occurred, assisting in tracking transactions and controlling the activities of these <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> objects. That database microservice subscribes to all the topics discussed above. The transactional tag field is read &nbsp;from the message body, and used by the database microservice, as the primary key during operations on the history log table. Transactional tags allow you to identify and track all tasks performed while processing each incident received from the monitoring tools.

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Throughout the project, other actions performed by the db microservice in database update functions, will also be seen, , either acting on the so-called metadata in MongoDB or on final data in the PostgreSQL relational tables. Therefore, all database operations performed by any element of the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> architecture are based on the SQLAlchemy ORM library, using two dialects: the MongoDB and PostgreSQL engines.

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">MongoDB stores metadata for all objects of the service tree. This includes customer, service and component identification, component configuration values, such as propagation and status rules, weight, type, creation and modification dates, parent identification, and other control information. On the other hand, PostgreSQL relational database stores the status or criticality of service tree components, as well the changes occurring in the service tree over time (addition, removal and alteration of components, component severity changes).&nbsp;</span>

          <p id="isPasted" style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">PostgreSQL also stores information about active sessions. During user login process, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span>
              <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span>creates a session and from there,&nbsp;<img src="images/kafka.png" width="570" align="center" style="width: 341px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fir">all communication between frontend and backend is uniquely identified through this session number. The session table in PostgreSQL stores the session owner, session status (active or not active), access mode (edit or read-only), current service tree, last session heartbeat datetime, and operations pending. Pending operations are those where the backend has not yet sent its results to the frontend, or those where the backend has already processed them and sent their results to the frontend and is waiting for a return from the frontend, before the transaction is complete.

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">After the login step and a new session has been established, the user must open a services tree. At this point, the server should query the two databases in MongoDB and PostgeSQL, to look up the tree structure and get the current state of its components, respectively. Using those information,<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> creates an image of the service tree in a json structure and returns it to the frontend, where the tree is then displayed

              <img align="center" style="width: 392px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil" src="images/frontback.png" width="570">Communication between the frontend and backend modules is always initiated by the frontend and is based on small packets sent within a periodicity established &nbsp;via the <span style="font-weight: 700;">keepalive configuration parameter</span>.. In their simplest form, these packets, also called heartbeats, contain in their payloads the identification of the session and the service tree identification, currently active on the user's station.

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">After receiving the heartbeat packets from the frontend, the Django view queries the service tree database, looking for changes in the status of any component of the service. If there have been changes, only the components involved in these changes and their new status are pushed back to the frontend.</span>

          <p style="line-height: 1.2;">
            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The frontend gets the web response from the backend, and if there are changes to be implemented in the hierarchical tree graphical interface, a new heartbeat packet is sent to the backend, confirming that the changes received in the last packet were successfully applied by the frontend. If the return of heartbeat packets sent by the backend does not indicate any change in the service tree, the frontend only returns an ack After the backend receives this "confirmation" from the frontend, Django view should remove the record from the database, through db microservice, if there are no open sessions having the same service active. &nbsp;That is, as long as there are sessions with the same service open and active, the update records referring to the status of its components will only be removed from the service tree database, after the last session returns an acknowledgment to the last update record sent . If the frontend does not send an ack packet, the records with this information will remain in the database, and the backend will try to resend this information in the next heartbeat package received from the frontend with the same service id.</span>

              <span class="u-text-black">To make these types of changes, sessions send the intended changes in the same heartbeat packet in the form of a json structure. It is noteworthy here that these requests cannot originate only from interactive sessions, where the user, using the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> graphical interface, executes editing and control commands. <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow users to programmatically manage different tree structures using POST requests.

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Regardless of the method used, whether interactively through sessions or programmatically with APIs, tree change requests for the same service can only be served one at a time. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> does not support concurrent edit operations on the same service tree. In the case of structural changes to a service tree, the metadata stored in MongoDB are changed and not just the records in PostgreSQL. Those changes will be sent for all sessions having the &nbsp;same service tree open, through the return of the heartbeat packets.

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">&nbsp;offers two user profiles. The administrator, in addition to the functions of changing and creating new service trees, can also view the progress of management of the business and infrastructure components. However, even if the administrator has the ability to change the service tree, whether in interactive or programmatic mode, a service tree can only be edited for a single session. Considering some users with administration profile and having open sessions in a specific tree of services, only one user-session will have the right to edit this tree. Thus, if an administrator requests editing of a service tree,&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">&nbsp;will fulfill the request only if no other session has the same service tree in edit mode. The administrator with the session in editing mode can return to read mode in an explicit way, interactively using controls on the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> page, or implicitly, if the user closes the session or the session heartbeat is not received by the nackend within a pre-time interval. set (changeable via the&nbsp;

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">In addition to reading mode and editing mode, a session from any user profile. can put the service tree in active or non-active mode. In active mode, structural or status changes to any of its components will be reflected in the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> page, while in non-active mode these changes will not be seen in the session. Here's an observation. Configuring a session in active or non-active mode, although from a session point of view it has the same effect, is different from the situation where the service tree is put under maintenance (reference: <span style="font-style: italic;">Section Operability and Maintenance</span>). In the latter case, although the monitoring tools report incidents and indicate the current status of monitored components, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer&nbsp;</span>will ignore them without any information being processed in this maintenance period, meaning that all active and non-active sessions will not reflect any updates to the service tree in this period. On the other hand, in case the session is placed in non-active mode by the user, only this specific session will not display any service tree update, and all other currently active sessions in this same period will reflect the changes reported by the tools external monitoring. It is recommended that &nbsp;a service tree put into edit mode by an active session, has other sessions in non-active mode until the edit is complete.

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">As already mentioned in <span style="font-style: italic;">Frontend to Backend Communication</span> section,<span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;</span>the <span style="font-weight: 700;">keepalive&nbsp;</span>parameter defines the time in seconds defining the interval that the heartbeat packet is sent to the backend. If a session does not send a heartbeat within this interval, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer&nbsp;</span>releases all data structures held in the backend regarding that session and returns an error to the frontend. Unless the tree is reopened, commands executed by the session will have no effect. The default is 60 and the minimum value is 30. When creating a user, keepalive is automatically set to its default value. In this way, all sessions opened by the user will have their heartbeat packets sent every 60 seconds, unless the administrator or the user who owns the session changes its value.

            <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The django-httpd service was deployed inside the container running Apache, which is used for reverse proxy to forward requests either to Django, via mod_wsgi, or the static file directory. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka and more the set of microservices are part of the other services that make up the <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> application. All containers initially run on a single VM. Although <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">ServiceXplorer</span> is based on swarm mode, no swarm cluster has been configured and therefore swam is a single node. On the other hand, in this type of configuration, it will be possible to grade the scalability of services by adding new workers, taking into account several factors such as the number of active users, volume and size (number of components and sublayers) of the service trees, and the values used for the keepalive parameter.
